# ESPHOME-Sensor2

The [first Sensor](https://github.com/WaarlandIT/ESPHOME-MMW) was just a test but this one is really usefull.

A mm wave sensor is sometimes too slow in detecting a person entering the room, adding a PIR sensor solves that issue.
Because I had some Arduino sensors unused in a box I added the DH2 sensor. The DH2 sensor read temprature and humidity. 

Also the first sensor was batery powered, that did not last long so this one is powered by USB.
